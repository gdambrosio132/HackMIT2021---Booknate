            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>
                A few years back, as one of our team members visited a rural area, a small group of children approached him. There was a spark in their eyes, a thirst for knowledge and a desire to see the world from a better perspective. Without proper books and materials they were helpless to get a better vision of the world. Not everyone in this world have the privilege of getting proper education. They might have access to schools but most of them are for name sake, without any proper facilities and libraries. Thatâ€™s where the idea of Booknate came to our mind. Booknate is a non-profit organization working towards making education more accessible for students in undeveloped countries. From shipping books and educational material to connecting students with the real world, we are committed to improving education through technology and sympathy. Join us to make this world a neutral ground in terms of education.
